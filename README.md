# AIFL: Ensuring Unlinkable Anonymity and Robust Incentive in Cross-Device Federated Learning

AIFL includes TARS-code and AIFL-code

## TARS
A threshold-based accountable ring signature (TARS) protocol to provide anonymity properties to clients, is the design basis of the proposed AIFL. Compared with current ARS schemes[1], the proposed TARS has two main enhancements after utilizing Pedersen VSS[2]. First, the de-anonymization privilege is distributed to multiple aggregators, enhancing the system's security. Second, the sub-key verifiability of the aggregator is increased.


## AIFL
- （1）System Initialization
- （2）TARS Process
- （3）Decentralized Global Aggregation
- （4）Robust Incentive Mechanism
